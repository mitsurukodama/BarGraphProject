This is a project I created for my Senior Project at UHD for CS3300: Object Oriented Programming.
It allows the user to upload a csv file to a page and create a stacked bar chart that can be downloaded as an image file after the graph is created. Multiple values can be selected together to stack multiple bars on top of each other.
